# What is World? #

World is a vintage social networking project -- A multiuser interactive animated dynamic environment within a color ASCII text terminal.

World is implemented in World Scheme which is loosely based on the R^5RS Scheme specification with added threads, socket and virtual machine support.  Both scheme and the VM are implemented in C.

# How Do I Connect? #

Make sure your terminal support 256 color escape codes such as PuTTY and xterm-256color.

telnet:
```
telnet 72.14.188.107 7154
```

ssh:
```
ssh world@72.14.188.107
```
